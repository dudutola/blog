Habits, very easy to start and very easy to let it go. 1% of the same habit in 1 year changes everything for the good, or the worst.
The good ones take time, patience, so be cool with yourself. Negative thoughts will make you believe that you are a part of them, and you'll see the world the same way you see yourself.
Goals are good, it make us feel alive, but we can do things without naming it. How many times you've told yourself "If I pass this class, I'll enjoy living", "When I'll got my driver licence, I'll do all the stuff I want to do", "I'm going to be happy". Now tell me why, 6/7 months later (to not say years) you are not in this mindset ?
Sometimes having goals makes you believe only the "you" in the future deserves better. So move on : keep the bedroom clean. Having troubles with sleep; sleep earlier, you'll wake earlier either way. Don't like routines, try new methods as reading, drawing, keep learning.
