The terminal, also called command line interface or command line interface (CLI) or the console, is an interface in which you can interact with your computer by writing lines called commands. These commands must be written in a specific language called Bash.

The main basic Bash commands:
- `pwd`: prints the path of the current folder (print working directory)
- `ls`: list files and folders in current folder
- `cd path/to/go`: navigates from one folder to another (change directory). To go back, use .. , which refers to the parent folder
- `mkdir folder_name`: creates a new folder (make directory)
- `touch file_name`: creates a new file
- `mv file_name path/to/the/folder`: moves the file into the folder
- `rm path/to/the/file`: delete a file (remove)
- `cat file_name`: displays the contents of a file
