HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) : an application protocol that defines how data is transmitted and exchanged between web servers and web browsers.
Client( pc) --/-> HTTP request with a url "https://www.lewagon.com" ---/> Server --/-> Http response with HTML file.
Every action on a website triggers an HTTP request.

2 different approaches to build websites :

    - static : (Get https://www.lewagon.com) the server fetches the HTML file and sends it back to the client in the HTTP response. Simple words : pre-defined content that remains the same for all users + does not change unless manually updated.

    - dynamic : (Get https://facebook.com/Dulcelene) the server builds the HTML file using a backend language and SQL queries to a database. Then, sends it to the client in the HTTP response Basically, it's based on user requests and data.

Front-end : the visual. It's about the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or application.
3 languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create the visual elements, layout, and interactivity of a website.

Back-end : the brain. It focuses on the server-side of web applications, dealing with data storage, processing, and communication with the front-end. Also : data manipulation, authentication, business logic, and integration with external services or APIs.
Languages like : Ruby, Java, PHP, Python.
