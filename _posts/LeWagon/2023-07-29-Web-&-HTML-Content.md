Internet is a place for everybody. Accessibility in HTML refers to the practice of designing and coding web pages in a way that makes them usable and accessible to individuals with disabilities. It involves considering the needs of people with various impairments, such as visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities, and providing them with equal access to the content and functionality of a website. For exemple, creating enough contrast between colors and text so that the content is readable for people with color blindness or adding the right HTML tags so that the website is easily explained by screen readers. So, making it accessible is not just an option, it must be a normal thing.
