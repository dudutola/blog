We have to learn that we are not perfect, that perfection doesn't exist. Therefore, we have to try to conquer things that are within our reach! We can't start a habit on a level bigger than ourselves. We have to gather things equal to our person. For example, sometimes we don't have the motivation to do something, some work, but why do certain people have dreams and manage to achieve them? Because they do everything possible to achieve it, they got the motivation and desire, contrary to us who choose habits that don't really suit us.

Our brain loves challenges, but it has to be a difficulty we can achieve. If it's too little or too big, we quickly lose focus. And we have to do everything possible to keep the experience attractive, because if we get bored, that leads to failure. Boredom is part of the experience, we have to get bored in order to continue. The more you train something, the routine becomes boring, the same happens with habits, they stop giving us pleasure.

That's why the important thing is not to give up when the habit becomes boring, that's exactly when we have to give everything we've got. NO one is gonna do it for us.
