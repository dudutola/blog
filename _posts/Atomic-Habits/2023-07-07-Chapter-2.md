Identity it's all about it. Before changing anything, we should focus not on the results but in our identity, the key is there. We must believe that we can do things. Do you remember when you were a kid, family will ask you if you were going to pass your examens, and you were sure enough to say yes even without seeing the results. It's because of your methods, habits of studing made you think that!
Be confident it helps too. If you are struggling doind something, there's a method that consists in thinking like someone who does it, be a fan. Stop with the "I'm useful", you believe in that. Habits are there to make you feel better, you doing a better version of yourself, your identity, the one you'll appreciate.
Sometimes having goals makes you believe only the "you" in the future deserves better. So move on : keep the bedroom clean. Having troubles with sleep; sleep earlier, you'll wake earlier either way. Don't like routines, try new methods as reading, drawing, keep learning.
