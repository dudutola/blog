For a habit to be efficient, we must practice it every day, and in the end it will become easier. We people, we don't really know how to create and keep an habit. The thing is that we think about it, we tell ourselves that we'll do it and then that's all.

There is a difference between doing something and thinking of doing it. So the difference we face here is about be on the move and be in action. Being in the move is a good thing indeed, we make plans, search for strategies, but there are no results. On the other hant, be in action will give us results. For exemple, you again, keeping telling yourself you'll be happy, where are the actions, you want to change, again where are the actions. It's funny because, you don't do those things because you are affraid of failling them, don't be accepted, that's why you keep avoiding them. Be in the move give us this good feeling, security, we don't have to face it if we're making plans.

Keep practicing, that's how an habit will form. Don't be moving, be in action, repetition, this way the habit will become automatic. The key isn't to know how long I've been practicing something, but how many times I've done a habit.
