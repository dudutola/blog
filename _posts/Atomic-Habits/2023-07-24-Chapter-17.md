Sometimes we do things because other people do. It's kind of a cultural thing. One solution to be able to follow the routine, is to make the habit painful. Simply add pain or fear to the habit. But many times we prefer to avoid it, because what does not bring us satisfaction, we don't want. But adding that to bad habits it's good, it's a good behavior to stop that habit. However, the pain of making a mistake makes us (sometimes) want to improve ourselves and do better. So to improve the habit we have to add a cost to it.

The consequences make us change our behavior. Fear makes us try to get it, and not make mistakes. if you think that you are not able to carry out a certain habit, try to find some consequence to it. The best is to have someone supervise. This makes us more willing to continue and improve ourselves. Because on the one hand we feel loved and believe on us.
