When we move to a new place, a bad habit that we have can disapear, just like magic. Why this happen ? It's because the environment changes, we are not dealing with the factor that make us dod this bad habit. But, if we gp back to that environment, the bad habits can come back, indeed, when they are created, even thought you stay years without thinking or doing it, you're back, they are back, because they are never forgotten.

Being self-control can help a lot, because less situations of tentation. It's easier to avoid tentation than resist them. You remember going back to Aix, was no help for you. Because all the bad habits were in that tiny room of yours, in uni, everywhere. The habits you tried to create, all disapeared really quickly, there was no space to good. The same thing happened with driving, you have bad habits about driving, that you feel not moving from them. While all you need is just a little confidence, that's all.

The solution in this case is to change the environment. Instead of making the cue that provokes those bad habits evident, we should hide them, or erase it a little of our life. Those habits must become difficult, uninteresting, invisible and unsatisfying.  We don't need them, take those bad habits away from you. Because, self-control is a good strategy, but does not stay forever, keep that in mind.
