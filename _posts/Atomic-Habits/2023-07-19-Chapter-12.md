We don't do things because we feel like they are exausting. So, the goal here is to learn how to make a habit with as little effort as possible.

That's why we must create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. In this case I understand what I have to do, but I don't know how to do it. I'm ashamed to live haha that's kinda ridiculous.But here we are.

To make habit easier, we have to reduce the resistance associated with good behaviors. When resistance is low, habits become easy. And we do the same with bad habits, if the resistance is bigger, the habits become difficult. My bad habit is my mind, I hope I can find the solution here. Do I have to put myself out in the worst way possible ?

One last thing, is to prepare your space. Make it livable. Yous study space is prepared everyday, so you can work, that's really good thing to do. So, improve the environment around you in order to make future actions easier. When you prepare everything at night in the morning you can catch a smile.
