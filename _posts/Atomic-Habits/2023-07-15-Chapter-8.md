We have to make the habit attractive. Habits are a dopamine-fueled feedback loop. The more attractive the opportunity, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

When dopamine increases, so does our motivation for action. Because it's something that make us feel good. This reaction exists because there is a reward after the action. It's the anticipation of a reward. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine peak.When you decided to drive, it wasn't for the drive itself, but the liberty you were looking for.
We must learn how to wrap temptations. And one of the ways to do it is to make habits more attractive.

The strategy is pairing an action you want to do with another one you have to do.

Ex :
1. After the (current habit), I'll do (habit I need)
2. After the (habit I need), I'll do (habit I want)
