It's important to create good habits, but it comes at a cost. Because in the beginning we have enough strength, will and desire to move forward but after a certain time, since we are already so used to it, we don't try to go further, we stagnate in what we already know, in automatic mode. Often from the moment we get something, we no longer have that need to improve it.

But of course, to achieve certain things, we have to combine the so-called automatic habits (because they don't take much effort) and purposeful training = mastery. Because after a habit has been mastered, we have to pass the hardest part, which requires a lot of effort and after that start a new habit.

And to keep the habit the best thing is to have a self-criticism. We have to criticize our actions and write them down so we can make comparisons over the weeks or months or even years to see how much we've changed or if we've made the same mistake again and again. In this way we will be aware of the steps we have taken.

Our identity is a big factor, and it's like friends or family. Clinging to one person will do us more harm than good. The same with identity, we cannot tie ourselves to a single identity that is supposed to evolve with us. The identity has to be flexible and not fragile. We have to redefine ourselves.
