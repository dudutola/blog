First thinhgs first, if we want to stop any bad habits we must make them uninteresting.

For exemple, you grown up being this inteligente child, making mistakes is something you actually never really learned. Now at 25 you still avoiding making mistakes because it makes you feel stupid, and you hate it. Feeling like you are perfect will be only painful, life will get more and more painful. You're just like everybody, mistakes are a part of us. Even though, you don't know to accept it. Learn.

Write down the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it unattractive. You can be happy, if you just let it go. We create those habits, because it felt good in the beginning, we were looking for a specific sensation, but what now?
Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive sensations and uninteresting when we associate them with negative sensations. The solution here, is to associate sensations with habits. create a motivation ritual by doing anything you enjoy right before a difficult habit. Feeling anxious, count, tell yourself something funny, think about the chickens, send your brain a safety message even if it's a terrible situation. I'm feeling anxious because I can do it (not otherwise).
