The first thing we have to do in order to change us is make the habit obvious, manifest those habits. There is no changes without work.

The 2 cues, are time and place.We have to associate every habit with a specific time and place. Not regular ones, must be fix. The formula is very easy by the way : I'll do (ACTION) at (HOUR) in (PLACE). Because associating habits with those commands feels less exausting, just a part of the normal routine. Try making lists, the normal habits we have in one day. It's a way to see further.

And, something possible is to associate a new habit with an old. It don't have to be similar. For this one the formula is : After the (ACTUAL HABIT), I'll do a (NEW HABIT). Introducing new habits, will show you that you have a lot of free time and even by occupying it with new things, free time still exists.
