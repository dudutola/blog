In life we have to start things, to start new habits. Simple ? But we prefere to choose the old habits, because it's easier. Everyday we have to choose things, and those choices will define how our journey will start or end. Try choose the good ones, feel free to do it.

If you feel tired, start new habits, maybe the old ones aren't really good. And if it's difficult, use the 2 minute rule everyday, you'll see the big changes. Maybe the first days you'll do it for only 2 minutes but then after, hours and hours. The thing is to start the habits easily, no big efforts. Because even though it's only 2 minutes or less, it's gonna change things in your behavior. Habits happen at decisive moments.

We need to ritualize the initiation of a process so we are more likely to enter the deep focused state needed to do important things. Start somewhere and then you'll see.
