With enough practice, our brain can identify and anticipate things, just by looking at it, unconsciously without really thinking of it. This is the result when we make efforts doing something that we know it is good for us. When habits turns automatic, we just do thingd, we not really think on the way to do it.
But to do that, and change our behavior, we have to accept those habits, and decide to change them, be aware that they exist. It can be difficult at first but with time everything is possible.
A little exercice is to write the things you have to do in your journeys, like the time you wake-up to the bed time. And not just write them, but put hours, places,be more specific, it can really help. And very important, say it loudly, it's one way to awake your spirit, listening to you saying it, will make it important and make it possible. At the end, your habits and you will be one.
