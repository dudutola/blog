We live surrounded by people who help us build our personality. Indeed, the culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.

We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved by our culture, because we must feel accepted, we have this strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.It's not a bad thing, if we know wich behaviors are the best for us. Those habits that we tend to imitate comes of the three social groups : the near (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestiges).

To create new habits, we must be a part of a culture. But this culture must have the behavior we are looking for, that is normal for us, and we must have something in common with it. If you want to practice code, your family must understand that and help you, this will make you feel seen. The group effect is something we see everywhere. For example, even a normal tribe behavior often dominates the behavior that the individual desires. MOst of the time, we'd rather be wrong whit the crowd than alone and right. It's a human thing, we want to be loved and accepted. We will consider a behavior that brings us approval, respect and praise.
